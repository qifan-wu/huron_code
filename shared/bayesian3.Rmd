## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(brms)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
df <- read_csv("tp_complete.csv")
df
```

```{r}
df[,c(5)] <- log10(df[,c(5)] + 0.00001)

df1 <- df[, c("ID", "site_ID", "results", "date", "season")]

df1 <- df1 %>%
     remove_rownames() %>%
     column_to_rownames(var = 'ID')

df2 <- df[, c("ID", "ppt", "tmean", "pshrub", "sf_conc", "sf_brick", "psoilD", "avg_depth", "pvac", "pdev_low", "pdev_open", "pdev_high", "psfconcrete", "struc_area", "med_high")]

df2 <- df2 %>%
     remove_rownames() %>%
     column_to_rownames(var = 'ID')

df2 <- scale(df2)
#head(df2)

d <- merge(df1, df2, by="row.names")
d
```
```{r}
write_csv(d, "test.csv")
```



tp:
"ID", "ppt", "tmean", "pshrub", "sf_conc", "sf_brick", "psoilD", "avg_depth", "pvac", "pdev_low", "pdev_open", "pdev_high", "psfconcrete", "struc_area", "med_high"

family gaussian
```{r}
bayesian_mixed_tp_gaussian = brm(
  results ~ psoilD + avg_depth + pvac + pdev_open + pshrub + ppt + tmean*pdev_low + tmean*sf_brick + tmean*psfconcrete + tmean*struc_area + tmean*med_high + ppt*pdev_high + ppt*avg_depth + ppt*sf_conc + (1 | site_ID),
  data = d, family = gaussian(), prior = set_prior("normal(-1,2000)")
)
summary(bayesian_mixed_tp_gaussian)
```


family student
```{r}
bayesian_mixed_tp_student = brm(
  results ~ psoilD + avg_depth + pvac + pdev_open + pshrub + ppt + tmean*pdev_low + tmean*sf_brick + tmean*psfconcrete + tmean*struc_area + tmean*med_high + ppt*pdev_high + ppt*avg_depth + ppt*sf_conc + (1 | site_ID),
  data = d, family = student(), prior = set_prior("normal(-1,2000)")
)
summary(bayesian_mixed_tp_student)
```


```{r}

```
```{r}
plot(bayesian_mixed_tp_student)
```

```{r}

  data = d, family = gaussian()
)
summary(bayesian_mixed_tp_gaussian1)
```
